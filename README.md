**Task 3: Financial Forecast**

A financial forecast was conducted using historical data. Assumptions were made for revenue growth, gross margin, and operating margin. Three scenarios were considered: 

- Weak (lowest value from history)
- Base (average value from history)
- Strong (highest value from history)

Predicted revenue, gross profit, and operating income were calculated using the assumed growth rates and the current year's financial figures.

Based on history:

- Revenue growth = (Next Year Revenue / Current Year Revenue) - 1
- Gross margin = 1 - (Cost of Goods / Total Revenue)
- Operating margin = Operating Profit / Total Revenue

The equations for the financial forecast are as follows:

- Predicted Revenue = Current Year Revenue * (1 + Assumed Revenue Growth)
- Predicted Gross Profit = Current Year Gross Profit * (1 + Assumed Gross Margin)
- Predicted Operating Income = Predicted Revenue * Assumed Operating Margin
